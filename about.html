  <h1>{{ site.name }}</h1>

  <p>I got into computers around the age of 6 or 7 when my dad brought home a computer he bought and it was running Windows 95 and I thought it was the most amazing thing. I eventually built my first computer at the age of 13 and have been obsessed with the power of computing and what it would do to the world ever since.</p>
  
  <p>I started developing simple HTML sites at around 14 when I was a fan of a card game and continued to want to get more and more advanced until getting into PHP and started builing PHP that changed with cookies.</p>
  
  <p>Around 16 I started building even more complex and dynamic sites driven by databases and continued to learn and grow. I started building game sites and grew one to a very large user base when I dived into the advertising world.</p>
  
  <p>I started many "businesses" or revenue generating sites by the time I was 18, but still continued to want to learn more about programming and so I started at a local social networking company called ONEsite that had amassed some very large clients. My career continued to grow and I became an even better developer and diving into industry standards and gaining social and communications skills dealing with clients.</p>
  
  <p>I have been doing amazing things on the web. It has always felt like the most amazing industry that can change overnight and connects millions of people around the world and so I hope to continue to build and innovate on the web.</p>
