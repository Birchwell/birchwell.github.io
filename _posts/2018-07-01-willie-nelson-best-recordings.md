Considering I haven't heard 1/3rd of his albums and haven't heard most of the bootlegs, there's probably a huge amount of stuff that I could put on this list. I've heard most of his highly regarded songs, but one of his major strengths is putting his own stamp on the material of others.

* 1966 - Yesterday - Live Country Music Concert (at Panther Hall) (One of the better covers of this Beatles' classic.)
* 1968 - Texas In My Soul - Texas In My Soul
* 1970 - Both Sides Now - Both Sides Now
* 1971 - Me and Paul
* 1973 - Whiskey River - Shotgun Willie
* 1973 - Local Memory - Shotgun Willie
* 1974 - Bloody Mary Morning - Phases And Stages
* 1975 - Time of the Preacher - Red Headed Stranger
* 1975 - Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain - Red Headed Stranger
* 1975 - Bach Minuet in G - Red Headed Stranger
* 1978 - Stardust - WHOLE ALBUM
* 1980 - Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground - Honeysuckle Rose Soundtrack (This version may be the best, with the crowd sounds mixed in.)
* 1980 - On The Road Again - Honeysuckle Rose Soundtrack
* 1980 - Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain (Live) - Midnight Special TV Show (His guitar progression at 2:20 to 2:25 is great.)
* 1981 - Mona Lisa - Somewhere Over the Rainbow
* 1981 - Over the Rainbow - Somewhere Over the Rainbow
* 1981 - Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground - Willie Nelson's Greatest Hits (And Some That Will Be) (This is a great version with a different arrangement and without the crowd sounds, as was the case with the Honeysuckle Rose version.)
* 1982 - A Whiter Shade of Pale - Always On My Mind
* 1982 - Always On My Mind - Always On My Mind
* 1982 - In The Jailhouse Now - In The Jailhouse Now w/Webb Pierce
* 1982 - Pancho and Lefty - Pancho and Lefty w/Merle Haggard
* 1984 - City of New Orleans - City Of New Orleans (My favorite version, with Jerry Reed's in second place.)
* 1984 - To All The Girls I've Loved Before w/Julio Iglesias (This appeared on Iglesias' album 1100 Bel Air Place. It was Nelson's biggest hit in Europe and Iglesias' biggest hit in North America.)
* 1985 - Hello Walls - Funny How Time Slips Away w/Faron Young
* 1995 - Me And Paul - Revolutions Of Time...The Journey 1975-1993 (This is my favorite version. I don't know on what album it originally appeared.)
* 1993 - Don't Give Up - Across The Borderline (This starts off great, but breaks down a bit.)
* 1996 - Spirit - WHOLE AlBUM (His guitar playing is spectacular, as are the songs and his singing. His best album. The highlights are She is Gone, Your Memory Won't Die in My Grave, I Guess I've Come to Live Here in Your Eyes)

I've listened to some of his post-Spirit stuff but nothing has clicked with me. Spirit might be his swan song as a first-rate talent.
