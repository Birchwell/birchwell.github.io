## Getting Started

I am not the best designer, but I feel I am able to distinguish good design from bad. I like to keep up with the design trends of the web and be active in the community.

## Resources

### Frameworks

One way is to build out design is by wireframing through frameworks as a base layer and add on your custom design on top.

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [Flat UI](http://designmodo.com/flat-free/)

### Inspiration

Designers learn, grow, and evolve together as a community just as programmers do through code. You can follow great designers through their work that you enjoy for inspiration.
